  [ ] could you make the red agent move at a constant speed instead of slowing down when it gets near the cursor?
  [ ] could you make a blue agent with a velocity that is controlled by arrow keys?
  [ ] could you make a green agent that follows the red agent?
  [ ] could you make the green agent follow the blue agent instead, if the blue agent is closer?
